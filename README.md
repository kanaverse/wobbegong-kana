# Wobbegong-Kana

Wobbegong-kana is an extension of Kana's explore mode for pre-analyzed datasets accessible through an ArtifactDB compatible search API e.g. [SewerRat](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/SewerRat) for finding datasets of interest.

This interface also uses the [wobbegong API specification](https://github.com/kanaverse/wobbegong-R) for retrieval of parts of a `SummarizedExperiment` object via HTTP range requests.

## Developer notes

This uses the React + Vite plugin.
